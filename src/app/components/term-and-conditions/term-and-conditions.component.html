            <p><b>15.1)</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; You agree that any violation by You of these Terms of
                Use will constitute
                an unlawful and
                unfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to the CLOREV Laundry, for which monetary
                damages would not be adequate, and You consent to CLOREV Laundry obtaining any injunctive or equitable
                relief that they deem necessary or appropriate in such circumstances. These remedies are in addition to
                any other remedies that CLOREV Laundry may have at law or in equity.</p>

            <p><b>15.2)</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Terms of Use will continue to apply until
                terminated by either You or
                Us as set forth
                below. If You object to the Terms of Use or are dissatisfied with the Platform, You may (i) close Your

                access to the Platform
                or suspend or
                terminate Your Account if it believes, in its sole and absolute discretion that You have violated any
                term of these Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy or anyway otherwise acted unethically. Notwithstanding
                anything in this Clause, all terms which by their nature are intended to survive such termination, will
                survive indefinitely unless and until CLOREV Laundry chooses to terminate them.</p>

            <p><b>15.4)</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If You or CLOREV Laundry terminates Your use of the
                Platform or any
                Service, We may delete
                any content or other materials relating to Your use of the Service and We will have no liability to You
                or any third party for doing so. However, Your transactions details may be preserved by Us for purposes
                of tax or regulatory compliance.</p>

            <p><b>15.5)</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; CLOREV Laundry may unilaterally terminate Your account
                on any event as
                mentioned in the
                Terms of Use. Any credits earned through loyalty or referral program and pending refunds (if any) will
                be forfeited in such case. Returns/Refund for such Users shall be at the sole discretion of CLOREV
                Laundry. However, You will be liable to pay any fees, charges or due (if applicable) in respect of the
                Services till the date of termination by either party whatsoever.</p>
